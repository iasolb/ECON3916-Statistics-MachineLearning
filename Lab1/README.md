Global Purchasing Power Parity Analysis
Objective
This project employs the Big Mac Index as a novel instrument to empirically test the Law of One Price and assess currency valuation across international markets.
Methodology

Data Collection: Constructed a structured dataset from The Economist's 2015 Big Mac Index, capturing local currency prices and actual exchange rates across multiple countries
PPP Calculation: Computed implied purchasing power parity exchange rates by comparing the cost of an identical good (Big Mac) across different economies
Valuation Analysis: Determined the percentage over- or undervaluation of each currency relative to the US Dollar baseline, identifying deviations from theoretical equilibrium

Key Findings
[Note: Insert your specific results here. Example format:]
The analysis revealed significant currency misalignments relative to purchasing power parity. The Norwegian Krone demonstrated substantial overvaluation at approximately [X]% above its implied PPP rate, suggesting potential arbitrage opportunities or structural market factors beyond simple price convergence. Conversely, emerging market currencies such as [currency name] exhibited undervaluation of [X]%, indicating purchasing power discrepancies that may reflect differences in non-tradable goods costs, labor markets, or trade barriers.
These findings underscore the limitations of the Law of One Price in real-world markets, where transportation costs, tariffs, and local market conditions create persistent deviations from theoretical parity.
