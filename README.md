📊 Economic Data Science Portfolio
Welcome! I'm an economics undergraduate developing skills at the intersection of economic theory and modern data science. This repository showcases my coursework from ECON 3916: Statistical & Machine Learning for Economics, where I'm learning to bridge traditional econometric methods with cutting-edge machine learning techniques.
🎯 About This Portfolio
This collection represents my journey in combining causal inference with predictive analytics—two pillars of modern economic analysis. Through this coursework, I'm exploring how classical statistical concepts can be extended and scaled using machine learning algorithms. For example, moving from ordinary least squares regression to regularized methods like Lasso, or from simple hypothesis testing to ensemble learning approaches.
The course follows a "Concept Extension" philosophy: we start with foundational statistical tools familiar to economists, then enhance them with ML techniques that handle high-dimensional data, non-linearities, and complex prediction tasks. This approach equips me to tackle real-world economic problems that require both rigorous causal reasoning and powerful predictive modeling.

Netflix's "Return-Aware Experimentation" framework treats statistical significance thresholds not as fixed scientific conventions but as levers calibrated to the expected return and cost of a decision. Rather than defaulting to p < 0.05 — an academic standard chosen largely for historical convenience — Netflix adjusts its decision thresholds based on factors like the business impact of a false positive versus a false negative, the cost to run longer experiments, and the revenue at stake. A low-risk UI tweak might warrant a looser threshold to ship faster, while a change affecting core engagement metrics demands a tighter one. This reflects a broader principle I carry into my work: decision thresholds are business parameters that encode tradeoffs between risk, speed, and value — not universal truths handed down from statistical tradition.

I'm currently seeking opportunities in [Data Analysis / Economic Consulting / Finance] where I can apply these skills to generate actionable insights from economic data.
