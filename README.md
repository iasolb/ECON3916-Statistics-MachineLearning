📊 Economic Data Science Portfolio
Welcome! I'm an economics undergraduate developing skills at the intersection of economic theory and modern data science. This repository showcases my coursework from ECON 3916: Statistical & Machine Learning for Economics, where I'm learning to bridge traditional econometric methods with cutting-edge machine learning techniques.
🎯 About This Portfolio
This collection represents my journey in combining causal inference with predictive analytics—two pillars of modern economic analysis. Through this coursework, I'm exploring how classical statistical concepts can be extended and scaled using machine learning algorithms. For example, moving from ordinary least squares regression to regularized methods like Lasso, or from simple hypothesis testing to ensemble learning approaches.
The course follows a "Concept Extension" philosophy: we start with foundational statistical tools familiar to economists, then enhance them with ML techniques that handle high-dimensional data, non-linearities, and complex prediction tasks. This approach equips me to tackle real-world economic problems that require both rigorous causal reasoning and powerful predictive modeling.
I'm currently seeking opportunities in [Data Analysis / Economic Consulting / Finance] where I can apply these skills to generate actionable insights from economic data.
